### Deployment üöÄ

The API was deployed on heroku, a free service that was made easy for me to use, however I have had experience deploying through AWS services, in RDS (Relational Database Service) S3 and Elastic Bean Stalk technologies.

1. Log in to heroku Account
``` 
- heroku login

```
2. Clone the repository

#### built with üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python** is a high-level language, is an interpreted language where any platform with an interpreter can run it, offers a variety of libraries and frameworks has a large community which allows exponential progress in learning.
- **Flask** is a microframework that allows to develop in an agile and fast way, it includes a development web server, you can run a web server to see the results that are being obtained.
- **SqlAlchemy** one of the features of SqlAlchemy is its ORM model, is a library that allows you to manipulate the tables of a database as if they were objects. It is responsible for making the appropriate translations and has a dependency on the database so you can easily modify the database engine.
- **Flask-Marshmallow** is a thin integration layer for Flask (a Python web framework) and marshmallow (an object serialization/deserialization library) that adds additional features to marshmallow, including URL and Hyperlinks fields for HATEOAS-ready APIs.
- **Flasgger** provides an extension (Swagger) that inspects the Flask app for endpoints that contain YAML docstrings with Swagger 2.0
- **Heroku** is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution, has the ability to support multiple programming languages and is currently a free service.

##### Architecture
- API REST 

- **Flassger** I used flassger for the documentation of the different proposed endpoints, in order to facilitate the review of them. LINK: https://cost-control-v1.herokuapp.com/swagger/#/ üî©

The architecture is a REST architecture, which is represented by the following diagram, in this case the client is a web browser, which communicates through HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with the API rest represented as an interface and making use of the flassger tool. The API, being a programmable application interface, exposes the required services through the corresponding endpoints, to finally communicate with the database through SQLALCHEMY.
